This project allows teams using TeamSnap to generate printable reports with attendance information that
can be used for contact tracing.  It also provides a web form that can be used by people who are not
using TeamSnap for attendance and health checks, and those form submissions will be included in the report
as well.

This not a free, open source project.  Source code is available reference / audit / portfolio / education
